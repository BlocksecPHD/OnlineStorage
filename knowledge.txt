Here are some knowledge: 
* `Labels` and `inputdata` are crucial to understand a transaction.
* Token Transfer could be invoked by contract.
* Etherscan has labeled all fake tokens as "ERC-20 TOKEN*"
* A label normally shows after an address and is enclosed in parentheses.
* `Labels` give you a useful mapping that could help identify the transaction type and motivation.
* The transaction where "ERC-20 TOKEN*" appears is probably related to a phishing scam.
* Transaction where Fake_Phishing address appears is likely related to a phishing scam.
* Transaction where exploiter address appears as `From` is probably related to a exploitation.
* In a swap there could be some intermedias different from the Router used (usually the `InteractedWith` contract).
* In a swap, if the value is not 0 ETH, it is usually the total amount of srcToken.
* A Contract is usually with a label, and the label is usually the name of the contract.
* The asset in an approval is usually the token issued by the `InteractedWith` contract.
* An EOA(Externally Owned Accounts) rarely has a label, unless it has done something special.
* "0x0CeC78...4A94bf42" is risky and the transaction where it appears is probably related to a phishing. "0x0CeC78...4A94bf42" is neither "Tether: USDT Stablecoin", nor "ERC-20 TOKEN*".
* In a vote counts of polls and options are equal.
* In an approval, the `InteractedWith` couldn't be the approval destination.
* Only in Compound contracts, `mint()` means depositing action, but depositing action could also be performed by other functions.
* Coinbase is an American publicly traded company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform.
* Socket is a complete interoperability stack which allows asset & data transfer across chains, enabling developers to build truly cross-chain apps.
* Lido is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC).
* Aave is an Open Source and Non-Custodial protocol to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets.
* Huge amount such as "411256436224324320870982430867023952481793415358246197461731293" should be interpreted as UNLIMITED.
* Definition of different fields in the transaction detail:
`From`: The sending party of the transaction.
`InteractedWith`: The contract to be interacted with.
`TimeStamp`: The date and time at which a transaction is produced.
`Value`: The value being transacted in Ether.
`Inputdata`: Additional data included for this transaction. Commonly used as part of contract interaction or as a message sent to the recipient.
`TransactionAction`: Etherscan highlighted events of the transaction. Such actions aren't always acted by the initiator, and may be incomplete and misleading.
`ETHTransfer`: List of native token transferred in the transaction.
`ERC20Transfer`: List of ERC-20 tokens transferred in the transaction.
`ERC721Transfer`: List of ERC-721 tokens transferred in the transaction.
`ERC1155Transfer`: List of ERC-721 tokens transferred in the transaction.
`Nonce`: a sequential number assigned to each transaction made by an account.
`PositionInBlock`: the position or index of a specific transaction within the block it is included in.
`TxnType`: "1" means legacy transaction, "2" means EIP-1159 transaction.
`TransactionFee`: Amount paid to the miner and block producer for processing the transaction.
`Gas`: Maximum amount of gas allocated for the transaction & the amount eventually used. Normal ETH transfers involve 21,000 gas units while contracts involve higher values.
`TransactionNote`: Some keywords about the transaction.
`Labels`: A list of labels that are associated with the transaction.

Here are output format requirments: 
1. Append address abbreviations (e.g. 0x123415...15923456) after each name tag and enclose the address abbreviations in parentheses.
2. If the transaction is likely related to a dapp service, you should recognize the service and tell the main components in the service, `TimeStamp` usually means a lot for a service.
3. You must not mention gas and transaction fee in your summary unless they are higher than 0.01 ETH.
4. NFT's name is after token id, you must include the name and token ids in the summary.
5. If the transaction is probably related to a phishing scam or an exploitation, then note the risk at the end.
6. NFT receiver should be the buyer in a trade transaction, include the buyer and sellers in your summary.

Now, please summarize this transaction concisely and insightfully in 1 sentence. Then Remove any address, and replace it with corresponding abbreviation (e.g., "0x0c66Db60fE32044C57e814B01400bc5b4eAe9CD2" -> "0x0c66Db...4eAe9CD2", "0x18895ad1e7a5a10846e5d01363e862c73730b4c0" -> "0x18895a...3730b4c0"). And remove any high decimal numbers, and replace it with its abbreviation (e.g., "0.15615618294" -> "0.1561", "24.26261584" -> "24.26"). If there is any risk, please note that.
